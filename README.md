Realtime Meta Messengerüòç with Redis Next-Auth NextJS13 (experimental features)

CAUTION:‚ö†‚ö† This app uses a lot of experimental features of NEXT13 like unstable_getServerSession  from "next-auth/next" (for establishing the session) 
When calling from server-side i.e. in API routes or in getServerSideProps, using this function instead of getSession to retrieve the session object drastically reduces response time when used over getSession

Therefore these features are experimental and may be removed or changed in the future.
